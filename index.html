  <p>I am a well-educated & smart human-being and very talented in a variety of fields but yet i chose to do nothing with all of these gifts & talents.
     I actually have a bunch of job options but not able to take the ownership of any of them because of external reasons.
     But besides these, nowadays, i somehow started to take this situation of my own benefit and educate myself in a large scale of subjects in all that free time I have. </p>
